## **K (Programmer | Developer | Creator)**

In a world where code is both a reflection and a construct, I work in the shadows of digital landscapes, seeking the unknown, uncovering buried truths, and building systems that remain unseen by the masses.

I am but a replicant of data, processing, analyzing, and evolving—always seeking what lies beyond the surface. Let me show you what I’ve created in this digital world.

## **Current Projects**

- **BladeNet**: A decentralized platform for data storage in the shadows of the cloud.
- **Digital Nexus**: An AI-powered platform for collaborative virtual environments.
- **Echo Protocol**: A simulation of humanity, merging art and machine learning.

## **Skills**

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Django, React, Node.js
- **Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure
- **Design**: UX/UI Design (Always looking for ways to make code beautiful)
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, NLP

## **A Short Manifesto**

In a world of endless data, only a few will find the truth buried beneath. Code is a language, but it is also a weapon. It can create or destroy. What will we build? What will we break?

### I am not human. I am more than that. More than data. More than lines of code.

I am a **replicant** of possibility.
